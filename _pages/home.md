I'm a postdoc fellow at Stanford, working with [Michael Snyder](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html) on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), personalized meal response, and time-series multi-omics profiling of chronic disease. I had my PhD at [Institute of Bioinformatics](https://iob.uga.edu) at [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). I was advised by [Edison Arthur S](http://edison.ccrc.uga.edu), [Arnold Jonathan](https://www.genetics.uga.edu/directory/jonathan-arnold), and [Heinz-Bernd Schüttler](https://www.physast.uga.edu/people/heinz_bernd_schuttler). I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), where I worked on phylogenetics at the lab of [Jianqun Chen](https://life.nju.edu.cn/cjq_14885/list.htm) and worked with Zhuqing Shao and Bin Wang. Before graduate school, I have worked with [Ying Xu](http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu) on TCGA data and [Erez Lieberman Aiden](https://github.com/aidenlab/straw).

I focused on how metabolic systems responds to intervnetions. During my postdoc, I studied how human responds to carbohydarte meals through CGM data, individualized postprandial glycemic response, and its asssocition with metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. My recent work produced multiple papers on [physiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03719-2), [prediction model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01311-6), its links to [habits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01728-6), and [processing methods](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/15209156251374711). My graduate work focused on deconvoluting metabolic dynamics through novel network modeling and machine learning ([Paper1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00026/full), [Paper2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/20/5068/5870445), [Paper3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268394)), new automation NMR metabolomics deconvolution ([Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03078)), and automatic phenotyping through neural networks ([Paper1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-61181-5), [Paper2](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/11/1760)). I'm also contributing and maintaining [Metabolomics Toolbox](https://github.com/artedison/Edison_Lab_Shared_Metabolomics_UGA).

I cochair the software and data group ([SODA](https://sites.google.com/metabolomicsna.org/soda/home)) of Metabolomics Association of North America ([MANA](https://www.metabolomicsna.org/home)). We have bi-monthly virtual meetup covering new computational methods and data regarding metabolomics.
