I'm a postdoc fellow at Stanford, working with [Michael Snyder](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html) on time-series multi-omics profiling of chronic disease. I had my PhD at [Institute of Bioinformatics](https://iob.uga.edu) at [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). I was advised by [Edison Arthur S](http://edison.ccrc.uga.edu), [Arnold Jonathan](https://www.genetics.uga.edu/directory/jonathan-arnold), and [Heinz-Bernd Sch√ºttler](https://www.physast.uga.edu/people/heinz_bernd_schuttler). I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), where I worked on phylogenetics at the lab of [Jianqun Chen](https://life.nju.edu.cn/cjq_14885/list.htm) and worked with Zhuqing Shao and Bin Wang. Before graduate school, I have worked with [Ying Xu](http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu) on TCGA data and [Erez Lieberman Aiden](https://github.com/aidenlab/straw).

Modeling the architecture and dynamics of biological networks and intepret biological time-series has been my main research topic. My graduate work focused on deconvoluting metabolic dynamics through novel network modeling and machine learning. My recent work includes extraction and analysis of time series metabolism ([Paper1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00026/full), [Paper2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/20/5068/5870445), [Paper3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268394)), new automation NMR metabolomics deconvolution ([Code](https://github.com/edisonomics/SAND)), new framework for modeling metabolic dynamics ([Code](https://github.com/artedison/ensRadaptor)). My work also involves MCMC, neural network([Code](https://github.com/artedison/NeuralSimODE), [Code](https://github.com/michaelSkaro/image_classification), [Code](https://github.com/Arnold-Lab/image_seg_sorghum_am)), and time series analysis ([Code](https://github.com/mikeaalv/fda_learn)). I'm also contributing and maintaining [Metabolomics Toolbox](https://github.com/artedison/Edison_Lab_Shared_Metabolomics_UGA).
