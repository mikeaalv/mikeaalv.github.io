I'm a PhD candidate at [Institute of Bioinformatics](https://iob.uga.edu) at [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). I'm advised by [Edison Arthur S](http://edison.ccrc.uga.edu), [Arnold Jonathan](https://www.genetics.uga.edu/directory/jonathan-arnold), and [Heinz-Bernd Sch√ºttler](https://www.physast.uga.edu/people/heinz_bernd_schuttler). I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), where I worked on phylogenetics at the lab of [Jianqun Chen](https://life.nju.edu.cn/cjq_14885/list.htm). Before graduate school, I have worked with [Ying Xu](http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu) on TCGA data and [Erez Lieberman Aiden](https://github.com/aidenlab/straw).

Modeling the architecture and dynamics of metabolic network has been my main research topic. I'm currently focusing on deconvoluting metabolic dynamics through novel network modeling and machine learning. My recent work includes extraction and analysis of time series metabolism ([Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00026/full)), network analysis of metabolic dynamics based on NMR data, new framework for modeling metabolic dynamics ([Code](https://github.com/artedison/ensRadaptor)). My work also involves MCMC, neural network([Code](https://github.com/artedison/NeuralSimODE), [Code](https://github.com/michaelSkaro/image_classification)), and time series analysis ([Code](https://github.com/mikeaalv/fda_learn)). I'm also contributing and maintaining [Metabolomics Toolbox](https://github.com/artedison/Edison_Lab_Shared_Metabolomics_UGA).
