I'm a PhD candidate at [Institute of Bioinformatics](https://iob.uga.edu) at [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). I'm advised by [Edison Arthur S](http://edison.ccrc.uga.edu), [Arnold Jonathan](https://www.genetics.uga.edu/directory/jonathan-arnold), and [Heinz-Bernd Sch√ºttler](https://www.physast.uga.edu/people/heinz_bernd_schuttler) . I graduate from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), where I worked on phylogenetics at the lab of [Jianqun Chen](https://life.nju.edu.cn/cjq_14885/list.htm). Before graduate school, I have worked with [Ying Xu](http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu) and [Erez Lieberman Aiden](https://github.com/aidenlab/straw).

Modeling explanation on biological phenomena has been the main topic of my research. My recent work includes [extraction and analyzing of time series metabolism](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00026/full), automatic analysis of time series NMR, new approach for modeling metabolic dyanmics. My work also involve MCMC, neural network, and time series analysis.
